## 🧬 Sample Input–Output Pairs (Health Checkup Dataset Example)

This repository contains `sample_data(1000)`, a **sample dataset constructed for research on large language model (LLM)-based interpretation of health checkup results**.
The data were **derived from the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) health checkup database (Korea)** and **sampled, anonymized, and structured** for demonstration and research reproducibility purposes.

### 📊 Dataset Description

Each record represents the results of a single health checkup and consists of **input (features)** and **output (labels)** used for model training and evaluation.

#### 🧩 Input (`sample_data(1000).csv`)

* **Demographic information:** `sex`, `Age code (5-year old unit)`
* **Anthropometric measurements:** `Height (5 cm unit)`, `Weight (5 kg unit)`
* **Clinical test results:**

  * **Blood pressure:** `SBP`, `DBP`
  * **Blood glucose:** `FBG`
  * **Lipid profile:** `TC`, `TG`, `HDLC`, `LDLC`
  * **Liver function:** `AST`, `ALT`, `γ-GTP`
  * **Renal function:** `SC`, `UP`
  * **Hematology:** `Hb`

> ⚙️ **Age code explanation:**
> The “Age code” represents 5-year age intervals (e.g., 5 = 20–24 years, 6 = 25–29 years, 7 = 30–34 years, etc.).

#### 🧾 Output (`sample_data(1000)_answer_label.csv`)

For each analyte, a categorical label indicates the interpretation result.
For example, `FBG` in `sample_data(1000)_answer_label.csv` corresponds to the fasting blood glucose interpretation:

0 = normal, 1 = Diabetes, 2 = Impaired Fasting Glucose.
